## I built a chatbot using transformer models trained on datasets like Cornell Movie Dialogs and Reddit chats. It understands and replies like a human by learning context through self-attention. I fine-tuned it to give relevant, consistent, and tone-controlled responses using methods like beam search and sampling.
## 📂 Dataset Used

This project uses the **Cornell Movie Dialogs Corpus**, stored in the `cornell_movie_dialogs` folder.

🧠 The dataset includes:
- `movie_lines.txt`
- `movie_conversations.txt`
- Other related files for building conversational AI models
