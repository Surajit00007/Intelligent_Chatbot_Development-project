# 🤖 Intelligent Chatbot Development
## 🔍 Project Description

I built a chatbot using transformer models trained on datasets like **Cornell Movie Dialogs** and **Reddit chats**.  
It understands and replies like a human by learning context through **self-attention mechanisms**.  
I fine-tuned it to give **relevant**, **consistent**, and **tone-controlled** responses using methods like **beam search** and **sampling**.
